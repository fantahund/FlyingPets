# FlyingPets (in progress - not working)
You can download development builds [from our Jenkins server](https://jenkins.fantacs.de/job/FlyingPets/).

Previously EpicPets. But completely rewritten and abandoned.
I wrote this code a long time ago so I publish it here
I don't have time to continue this project.
if you want to continue this project, fork it...

Shitty things I did here:
  - Storage system need a complete rewrite
  - I used Bukkit's methods in Async Thread.
  - Shitty "Reference" class
  - Other things I don't remember

Here are some pictures of what the plugin looked like if it can motivate some people :)

The dragon can also shoot fireballs.
